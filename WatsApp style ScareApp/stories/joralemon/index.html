            <p class="p">NYPD Preliminary Incident Report #619-346-62-BK</p>
            <p class="p">Marie Novak (24/f/w) of Queens reported a "torture chamber" underneath MTA facility at 58 Joralemon Street in Brooklyn (see attached 9-1-1 transcript).</p>
            <p class="p">Caller reported that her friend Jennifer Lao (22/f/a) of Manhattan was being held captive and had managed to send her a text message. Officers and paramedics were dispatched at 0005.</p>
            <p class="p">First responders did not locate anyone, including Ms Lao, in the service tunnels beneath 58 Joralemon. No evidence of habitation as described by Ms Novak was present.</p>
            <p class="p">There was evidence of forced entry, and preliminary investigation suggests that tools found in Ms Novak's possession (including lock picks, bolt cutters, and a bump key) were used by Ms Novak to gain illegal entry to the MTA facility. A more detailed forensic report is pending.</p>
            <p class="p">A single envelope (EVID-ID #45564) adressed to "Marie" was found in one of the rooms that Ms Novak broke in to.</p>
            <p class="p">Inside was a handwritten note which said:</p>
            <p class="p">"This city is full of people like you."</p>
            <p class="p">The whereabouts of Ms Lao remain unknown. NYPD Homicide has opened an investigation.</p>
            <p class="p">Marie Novak is our prime suspect.</p>
            <p class="p">She is currently being held on suicide watch.</p>
